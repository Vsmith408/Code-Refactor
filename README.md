# Code Refactor

Our assignment was to refactor the code into semantic HTML, the order of the elements were to be structured logically and clean up the CSS.

##### Here are some of the items that I fixed:

- grouped selectors with the same styling
- put all HTML tag selectors at the top of the CSS file
- added alt attributes to all img tags
- changed `div`s to more semantic HTML (including `main`, `section` and `aside` tags)
- changed the title name to be more descriptive
